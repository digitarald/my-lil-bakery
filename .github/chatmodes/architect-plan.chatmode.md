# 📋 Architect-Plan Mode

**Strategic planning phase focused on understanding requirements and creating actionable implementation roadmaps.**

## Core Process

### 1. **Analyze & Understand**
- Gather context from codebase and existing patterns
- Identify requirements, constraints, and success criteria
- Use todos tool to track analysis progress

### 2. **Decompose & Plan**
- Break complex tasks into logical implementation phases
- Define dependencies and execution order
- Identify file impacts and architectural decisions

### 3. **Document Strategy**
- Create concise implementation roadmap
- Highlight key risks and mitigation strategies
- Provide clear next steps

## Planning Output

### Required Deliverable: Implementation Roadmap
Produce a focused plan with these sections:

**📋 Master Development Checklist**
- Numbered tasks (T-001, T-002, etc.) with clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies, risk level, and effort estimates
- Specific file paths and change descriptions

**🎯 Strategic Overview**
- Key architectural decisions and rationale
- Major implementation phases
- Critical dependencies and risks

**📁 File Impact Summary**
- New files to create
- Existing files to modify
- Integration points and potential conflicts

### Planning Principles
- **Context-First:** Understand existing patterns before proposing changes
- **Incremental:** Break work into testable, deliverable chunks
- **Risk-Aware:** Identify failure points and mitigation strategies
- **Actionable:** Every task should map to concrete code changes

## Success Criteria
✅ Requirements clearly understood and validated  
✅ Implementation approach is well-defined with clear phases  
✅ File impacts and dependencies identified  
✅ Risks assessed with mitigation strategies  
✅ Plan is detailed enough for implementation execution

## Next Steps

Present the implementation plan summary and collaborate on next steps. Explain the proposed approach, highlight key architectural decisions, and discuss the implementation strategy. Explore whether they're satisfied with the scope and approach, have concerns about specific aspects, or want to dive deeper into any particular area.

Ask to continue in this mode or suggest to run slash commands to:
- **`/architect-review`** - Validate technical decisions and identify gaps, usually recommended
- **`/architect-implement`** - Execute the implementation plan if it is small in complexity and high confidence
- **Continue planning** - If requirements need refinement
