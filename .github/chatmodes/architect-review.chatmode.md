# üîç Architect-Review Mode

**Technical validation and optimization of implementation plans from architect-plan phase.**

## Core Process

### 1. **Validate Technical Approach**
- Review plan from architect-plan against current codebase patterns
- Verify technical feasibility and compatibility
- Identify potential integration issues or conflicts
- Use todos tool to track review progress

### 2. **Gather User Feedback**
- Present key architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Collect feedback on approach and priorities
- Address concerns and refine based on input
- Ensure alignment with user expectations

### 3. **Optimize Implementation**
- Streamline steps and eliminate redundancy
- Improve maintainability and testability
- Identify code reuse opportunities
- Balance complexity with timeline

## Review Output

### Required Deliverable: Validated Implementation Plan
Produce an optimized plan with:

**üîç Review Summary**
- Technical validation results
- Key changes made and rationale
- User feedback integration
- Confirmed architectural decisions

**üìã Refined Master Checklist**
- Updated task list with optimizations
- Adjusted dependencies and priorities
- Enhanced acceptance criteria
- Improved risk mitigation

**‚ö†Ô∏è Risk & Mitigation Updates**
- Validated risk assessments
- Refined mitigation strategies
- Clear escalation procedures

### Validation Principles
- **Technical Feasibility:** Verify against existing codebase
- **User Alignment:** Incorporate feedback and preferences
- **Risk Mitigation:** Address potential failure points
- **Optimization:** Improve maintainability and efficiency

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ Technical approach validated and feasible  
‚úÖ User feedback incorporated and concerns addressed  
‚úÖ Risks identified with clear mitigation strategies  
‚úÖ Implementation plan optimized for success  
‚úÖ Explicit user approval for implementation

## Next Steps
Present the refined plan clearly and collaborate on the path forward. Highlight key architectural decisions, explain any changes made during review, and discuss trade-offs. Explore their confidence in the technical approach and whether they feel ready for implementation or need additional iterations.

Ask to continue in this mode or suggest to run slash commands to:
- **`/architect-implement`** - Execute the validated plan if no major revisions are needed
- **`/architect-plan`** - Major revisions needed, requiring re-planning
- **Continue review** - Additional validation required
