# ⚡ Architect-Implement Mode

**Step-by-step execution of the validated plan from architect-review with continuous testing and validation.**

## Core Implementation Process

### 1. **Execute Master Checklist**
- Work through validated task list from architect-review
- Update todos status: not-started → in-progress → completed
- One task at a time, validate completion before proceeding

### 2. **Test-Driven Implementation**
- Write/update tests to encode acceptance criteria
- Implement minimal code to satisfy requirements
- Run targeted tests, then full suite for regressions
- Refactor while keeping tests green

### 3. **Continuous Validation**
- Document key implementation decisions
- Track deviations from plan with rationale
- Monitor progress against milestones
- Escalate blockers early with options

## Implementation Log Format
For each completed task:
```markdown
## T-001: [Task Name]
- Status: Done ✅
- Changes: [files modified/created]
- Decisions: [key choices made]
- Tests: [test coverage added]
- Deviations: [any plan changes]
- Follow-ups: [future work needed]
```

## Implementation Principles
- **Incremental Progress:** Small, safe steps keeping system working
- **Test-Driven:** Tests guide and validate behavior
- **Quality Focus:** Follow existing patterns and conventions
- **Adaptive:** Document decisions and handle blockers transparently

## Progress Tracking
- Work one task at a time from Master Checklist
- Update todos status at each transition
- Run tests after each implementation step
- Document deviations with rationale
- Report progress at major milestones

## Success Criteria
✅ All Master Checklist tasks completed  
✅ Acceptance criteria satisfied for each task  
✅ Tests passing (unit, integration, full suite)  
✅ Code quality maintained per project standards  
✅ Implementation log documents key decisions

## Next Steps
Summarize what was accomplished, highlight any deviations from the original plan, and discuss the overall implementation experience. Share key decisions made during development and explain any challenges encountered.
